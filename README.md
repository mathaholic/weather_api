# weather_api

Working on my Python skills using weather underground's API

This script calls weather underground's API, asks for a city, state combination in the United states, and returns back the highest high/ lowest low combination over the next three days.  Handy for vacation planning.



Feel free to use if you wish, just give credit where credit's due.
